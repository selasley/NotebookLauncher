# NotebookLauncher
Applescript app to server as a launcher for Jupyter notebooks

It simply opens Terminal.app and runs jupyter notebook path-to-ipynb-file.  The Info.plist
file sets it up as a viewer for ipynb files so you can set it as the Open With application
for ipynb files and double click on them to launch the notebook.

NOTE: Launching notebooks this way does not automatically open the Home page that 
launching with "jupyter notebook" does.
